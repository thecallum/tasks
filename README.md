## What I learned


### Laravel

I was learning Laravel at the time from Laracasts. Tasks was a project for me to use what I had learned over the course. My favourite part of Laravel is Eloquent ORM, which is a much more powerful way to manage data and relationships. 

I particularly enjoyed code-first migrations, which makes it easy to update the database in a safe and maintainable way.
